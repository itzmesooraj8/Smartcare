## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.


**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.

## What technologies are used for this project?
# Smartcare

A telehealth / medical records web application. This repository contains a TypeScript React frontend (Vite) and supporting backend services (signaling server and Python backend with database migrations). The sections below list what is required to run, how the components are organised, and recommended steps for local development, testing, and deployment.

## What is needed (high level)

- Development machine with Node.js (recommended v18+). Bun is present in the repo (bun.lockb) and may be used as an alternative package manager.
- A package manager: npm, yarn or pnpm (or bun). Use the tool you prefer.
- Python 3.10+ for the backend services in `smartcare-backend` (virtual environment recommended).
- A relational database (PostgreSQL recommended) for running migrations and storing persistent data.
- Docker (optional) to run services such as Postgres locally via `docker-compose` (a `docker-compose.yml` is present in `smartcare-backend`).

## Repository layout (important folders)

- `/src` — Frontend (Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind). Main app and pages live here.
- `/server` — Node signaling server (WebRTC signaling / sockets). Check `server/package.json` for scripts.
- `/smartcare-backend` — Python backend, Alembic migrations and database-related code.
- `/public` — Static assets served by the frontend build.

## Environment variables (what you will need)

These are common variables you should provide for local development. Exact names are in the backend/frontend config files — use these as examples:

- Backend (Python):
  - DATABASE_URL (Postgres connection string)
  - SECRET_KEY or JWT_SECRET
  - SMTP_HOST / SMTP_USER / SMTP_PASSWORD (optional, for emails)

- Frontend (Vite):
  - VITE_API_URL (URL to the backend API)
  - VITE_WS_URL (WebSocket / signaling server URL, if applicable)

Create a `.env` file in the relevant service directories (or use your system environment) and never commit secrets to git.

## Quickstart — local development (recommended steps)

1. Clone the repo and open it:

```powershell
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd smartcare
```

2. Install frontend dependencies and run the dev server (from repo root):

```powershell
# using npm
npm install
npm run dev

# or using pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm dev

# If you prefer bun
# bun install
# bun dev
```

3. Start the signaling server (if you need real-time features):

```powershell
cd server
npm install
# check `server/package.json` for the correct script (commonly `npm run dev` or `npm start`)
```

4. Prepare and run the Python backend (in `smartcare-backend`):

```powershell
cd smartcare-backend
# create and activate a venv (PowerShell)
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt  # or follow pyproject/poetry instructions if present
# create .env with DATABASE_URL and other secrets
# run alembic migrations
alembic upgrade head
# start the backend (check app/main.py or package scripts)
```

If you prefer Docker, use the `docker-compose.yml` in `smartcare-backend` to bring up Postgres and the backend.

## Database migrations

Migrations are managed with Alembic inside `smartcare-backend`. Before running the app against a fresh database:

- Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is set and points to a reachable Postgres instance.
- Run: `alembic upgrade head` from the `smartcare-backend` directory.

## Testing

- Frontend: run the configured test runner (check `package.json` in the root). Common commands are `npm test` or `pnpm test`.
- Backend: use pytest from within the Python virtual environment.

## Deployment notes

- Static frontend builds: `npm run build` produces the `dist` directory (served by Netlify, Vercel, or any static host).
- Backend: deploy the Python app to your preferred host (Docker, cloud provider). Make sure to provide environment variables and run database migrations on deploy.
- CI/CD: include steps to run tests, build the frontend, and apply migrations before switching traffic.

## Operational ports and URLs (common defaults)

- Frontend dev server: http://localhost:5173 (Vite default)
- Signaling server / WebSocket: configurable — check `server` code for default port
- Backend API: configurable via `VITE_API_URL` / `DATABASE_URL`

## Contributing

- Please open issues for bugs or feature requests.
- For code contributions, fork the repo, create a topic branch, and submit a pull request with a clear description and tests where applicable.

## License and attribution

Include a LICENSE file in the repo root. If this is an internal project, update the README with the appropriate legal or usage notes.

---

If you want, I can now:

1. Tailor the README to use exact script names by reading `package.json` and backend entry points, or
2. Add example `.env.example` files (safe, with placeholders) for frontend and backend.

Tell me which option you prefer and I will update the README further and apply small supporting files.
